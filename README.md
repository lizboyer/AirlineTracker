## File Location

### ./cpp-project-template-main/algorithms
To find the definition of all algorithms that have been used, in the cpp-project-template-main directory, in the algorithms folder, under the src folder, algorithms.cpp will be located. The header file, algorithms.h will be located in the include folder. The test cases for the algorithms will be located in the tests folder.

### ./cpp-project-template-main/algorithms/data
In the cpp-project-template-main directory inside the data folder, all the formatted and unformatted data sets will be present.

### ./cpp-project-template-main/algorithms/parsing
To find the definition of all methods in the AirTravel class, in the cpp-projet-template-main directory, in the parsings folder, graph.cpp will be inside the src folder while the header file, graph.h will be inside the include folder. The test cases for the AirTravel class will be located in the tests folder.

## Running Instructions

1. Change directory to cpp-project-template-main/
2. cmake3 .
3. make


### Main
â€¦

### Testing
To confirm that each algorithm was working as intended, we made sufficient smaller test cases that considers each edge case for each algorithm. We also ran tests using the full data sets of airports and routes to confirm that our algorithm is working as expected.

To test all algorithms after running make, input: 
./algorithms/test-algo

To test the graph after running make, input:
./parsing/test-parsing

### Clean
make clean
