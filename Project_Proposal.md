## 1. Leading Qestion


## 2. Dataset Acquisision
**Data Format** 
Data from Openflights. What data do we want? We will need the Airport Database (CSV, 14110 lines) almost certainly. How will we process the data (directly into cpp or some other processing first?
We'll want the route database ( comma-delimited file, ). 
We probably don't want airline data? not sure how that would be useful.
Probably don't want planes database?
Probably don't want contry

**Data correction** 
it says on the site that the 3-letter airport identification code will sometimes be null if unknown (there is also a 4-letter code). this is important for mapping routes to airports. what will we do when this happens? in the route database, airports will have either the 3-letter or the 4 letter code. do we need to do some correction 


**Data Storage**
I assume this is where we will discuss how we will store our graph? maybe we need to describe how the inputs are stored while we build our graph. 

## 3. Graph Algorithms
Probably list the main algorithms here
*Traversal (BFS or DFS)
*Shortest path, Dijkstra's?
*Betweenness centrality?

**Function Inputs**

**Function Outputs**

**Funtion Efficiency**
Traversal is O(n), where n = number of nodes.


## 4. Timeline
by when do need to have our data aquisition stuff done?
next steps?
