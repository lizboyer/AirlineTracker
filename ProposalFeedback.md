### Comments

The proposal is very well-written, and it is very impressive that you have considered the dis-connected subgraph problem. Here is one suggestion for your graph construction. 

**Dataset**

In the dataset description, you mentioned that "...each node will contain all of the routes connecting it to other airports.". I assume you mean each node will store the edge connection information. This implementation is fine, but it might cause you some minor runtime trouble during graph construction, and there are other node and edge storing formats that you may want to consider. We will also cover some of them in the futrue lectures.
