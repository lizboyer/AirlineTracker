Final project for kyuhahp2-eboyer2-mac18-pkr3

# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meeting** Our team will have our meetings every week on Tuesdays at 8 pm CST. This date may be subject to change each week. Our meetings will last at least one hour. Discord will be used to host the meetings. Any conflicts with the time will be notified at least a day before. We will rotate between team members to take notes on the meeting.

2. **Assistance** Each team member will use Discord or Email to contact if help or opinion is needed. Messages will be responded within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** Every team member will be encouraged to talk during team meetings and responses will be honest and respectful.

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** The work distribution will be set each week during the team meeting. 

2. **Time Commitment** Each team member is expected to work at least two hours per week. Every Thursday, each team member will be required to update the group on Discord of the progress that they are making on their assigned component for the week. If an assigned component is taking longer than expected, other team members will join to help finish the component.

3. **Conflict Resolution** If a team member does not join a Discord meeting without notifying the day before or is consistently late, the team member will be asked to explain their situation. If the issue persists, staff will be notified. Additionally, if a team member's assigned work is incomplete the same steps will be taken. If there is a disagreement between team members, a voting system will be used.
